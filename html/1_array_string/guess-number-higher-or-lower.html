        <question_title>374. Guess Number Higher or Lower</question_title>
        <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/description/">Link to LeetCode</a>
        <question>
            We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
            I pick a number from <x>1</x> to <x>n</x>. You have to guess which number I picked (the number I picked stays the same throughout the game).
            Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
            You call a pre-defined API <x>int guess(int num)</x>, which returns three possible results:
            - -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
            - 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
            - 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
            <i>Return the number that I picked.</i>

            <b>Example 1:</b>
            Input: n = 10, pick = 6
            Output: 6
            
            <b>Example 2:</b>
            Input: n = 1, pick = 1
            Output: 1
            
            <b>Example 3:</b>
            Input: n = 2, pick = 1
            Output: 1
