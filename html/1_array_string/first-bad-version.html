        <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/description/">Link to LeetCode</a>
        <question>
            You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

            Suppose you have <x>n</x> versions <x>[1, 2, ..., n]</x> and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

            You are given an API <x>bool isBadVersion(version)</x> which returns whether <x>version</x> is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
        </question>
        <question>
            <b>Example 1:</b>
            Input: n = 5, bad = 4
            Output: 4
            Explanation:
            call isBadVersion(3) -> false
            call isBadVersion(5) -> true
            call isBadVersion(4) -> true
            Then 4 is the first bad version.
            
            <b>Example 2:</b>
            Input: n = 1, bad = 1
            Output: 1
