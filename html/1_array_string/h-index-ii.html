        <question_title>275. H-Index II</question_title>
        <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/description/">Link to LeetCode</a>
        <question>
            Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in non-descending order, return the researcher's h-index.

            According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index">definition of h-index on Wikipedia</a>: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

            You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

        <question>
            <b>Example 1:</b>
            Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
            Output: 3
            Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
            Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

            <b>Example 2:</b>
            Input: citations = [1,2,100]
            Output: 2
