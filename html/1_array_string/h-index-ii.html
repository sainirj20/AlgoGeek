            <b>Example 1:</b>
            Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
            Output: 3
            Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
            Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

            <b>Example 2:</b>
            Input: citations = [1,2,100]
            Output: 2
