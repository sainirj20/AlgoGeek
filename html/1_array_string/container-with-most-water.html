        <question_title>11. Container With Most Water</question_title>
        <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/">Link to LeetCode</a>
        <question>
            You are given an integer array <x>height</x> of length <x>n</x>. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the <x>ith</x> line are <x>(i, 0)</x> and <x>(i, height[i])</x>.
            Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
            Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
            Notice that you may not slant the container.
        </question>
        <question>
            <x>Example 1:</x>
            Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
            Output: 49
            Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

            <x>Example 2:</x>
            Input: height = [1,1]
            Output: 1
        </question>
        <notes>
            <b>Analysis</b>
            Initially we can assume the result is 0. Then we scan from both sides. 
            If <x>leftHeight < rightHeight</x>, move right and find a value that is greater than leftHeight. 
            Similarily, if <x>leftHeight > rightHeight</x>, move left and find a value that is greater than rightHeight. Additionally, keep tracking the max value.

    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length < 2) {
            return 0;

        int max = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            max = Math.max(max, (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]));
            if (height[left] < height[right])
                left++;
            else
                right--;
        }

        return max;
