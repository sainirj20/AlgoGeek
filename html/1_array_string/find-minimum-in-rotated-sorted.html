        <question_title>153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array</question_title>
        <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/">Link to LeetCode</a>
        <question>
            Suppose an array of length <x>n</x> sorted in ascending order is rotated between <x>1</x> and <x>n</x> times. 
            For example, the array <x>nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]</x> might become:

            - <x>[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]</x> if it was rotated 4 times.
            - <x>[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]</x> if it was rotated 7 times.
            Notice that rotating an array <x>[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]</x> 1 time results in the array <x>[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]</x>.

            Given the sorted rotated array <x>nums</x> of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

            You must write an algorithm that runs in <x>O(log n)</x> time.

            <b>Example 1:</b>
            Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
            Output: 1
            Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

            <b>Example 2:</b>
            Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
            Output: 0
            Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

            <b>Example 3:</b>
            Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
            Output: 11
            Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
