            <b>Example 1:</b>
            Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
            Output: 3
            Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
            Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

            <b>Example 2:</b>
            Input: citations = [1,3,1]
            Output: 1
