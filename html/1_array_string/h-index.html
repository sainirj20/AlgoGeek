        <question_title>274. H-Index</question_title>
        <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/">Link to LeetCode</a>
        <question>
            Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

            According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index">definition of h-index on Wikipedia</a>: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.
        </question>
        <question>
            <b>Example 1:</b>
            Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
            Output: 3
            Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
            Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

            <b>Example 2:</b>
            Input: citations = [1,3,1]
            Output: 1
