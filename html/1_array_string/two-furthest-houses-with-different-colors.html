        <question_title>2078. Two Furthest Houses With Different Colors</question_title>
        <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-furthest-houses-with-different-colors/description/">Link to LeetCode</a>
        <question>
            There are n houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a 0-indexed integer array colors of length n, where colors[i] represents the color of the ith house.

            Return the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.

            The distance between the ith and jth houses is abs(i - j), where abs(x) is the absolute value of x.
        </question>
        <question>
            Input: colors = [1,1,1,6,1,1,1]
            Output: 3
            Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.
            The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.
            House 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6. The distance between them is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
            Note that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.

class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] colors) {
        int i=0, end = colors.length-1;
        while (i < colors.length && colors[i] == colors[end]) {
            i++;
        }
        int j=end;
        while (j>=0 && colors[0] == colors[j]) {
            j--;
        }
        return Math.max(Math.max(i, end - i), Math.max(j, end - j));
